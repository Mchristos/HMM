# HMM

An abstract formulation of Hidden Markov models written in C#. 

This library allows you to formulate a problem as a [Hidden Markov model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model). Once you've encoded your problem as an HMM and have a sequence of observations, you can solve for the most likely sequence of states using the [Viterbi algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm).
